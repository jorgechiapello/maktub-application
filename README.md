# Maktub App

## Introduction

This is a repository to implement a prototype of Maktub, a dating app designed to create meaningful connections by integrating a unique bar experience in Barcelona.&#x20;

Unlike traditional dating platforms, Maktub pairs users based on shared interests and facilitates real-life interactions in a safe and engaging environment.

## Objective

The goal is to build a client-side web application that's easy to share and showcase. It's meant to be a prototype, so all data is hardcoded and mocked.

## Installation & Setup

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/maktub-app.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd maktub-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
