# Maktub App

## Introduction

This is a repository to implement a prototype of Maktub, a dating app designed to create meaningful connections by integrating a unique bar experience in Barcelona.&#x20;

Unlike traditional dating platforms, Maktub pairs users based on shared interests and facilitates real-life interactions in a safe and engaging environment.

## Objective

The goal is to build a client-side web application that's easy to share and showcase. It's meant to be a prototype, so all data is hardcoded and mocked.

3. Install dependencies:
