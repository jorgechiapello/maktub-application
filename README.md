# Maktub App

## Introduction

This is a repository to implement a prototype of Maktub, a dating app designed to create meaningful connections by integrating a unique bar experience in Barcelona.&#x20;

Unlike traditional dating platforms, Maktub pairs users based on shared interests and facilitates real-life interactions in a safe and engaging environment.
